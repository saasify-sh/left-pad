This SaaS project was bootstrapped with [Saasify](https://saasify.sh).

Note that this template includes an example OpenAPI spec pointing to [httbin.org](https://httpbin.org). You'll want to replace this spec with one representing your externally hosted API.

See our [quick start](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/quick-start) for a walkthrough of how to get started and our [OpenAPI guide](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/openapi) for more information on generating your own OpenAPI spec.
